# mortgage_vs_renting
a python model that compares the long run cost of renting vs owning

this python model will take a number of high level parameters associated with owning a home and then generalise comparable costs when renting

this model should give the user a complex tool to compare the total cost of ownership against rent, over a person's lifetime.
